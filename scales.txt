A key always uses each letter; this determines if # or b is selected

Chord names are based on the semi-tones between notes of the scale:
maj 0 4 7
min 0 3 7
dim 0 3 6
aug 0 4 8

ARP could count up from ROOT note. Since there are only 7 notes 'in key' this provides 2 octaves:
Note-value: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F (value 'F' is free if you max out at 2 octaves)
Note:       G A BbC D EbF G A BbC D EbF G

TODO:
- See http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/mos_6581_sid.pdf 
- music_init restart song
- instrument frequency -> note offset
- ARP/bass line notes
- (ARP) key (12 notes minor + major = 24 possibilities)(global?)
- (ARP) octave (freqs range from C-0 ($01?? )to B-7 ($1F???), so 8 octaves = 3 bits)
- pattern bytes:
  - 00     = do nothing
  - Y1..YF = instrument (X-1=0..14) plays note Y (0=root, 1=root+1 in key, ... up to E)
  - F0..FE = delay X+1 raster lines (00 does nothing, F0 waits 2 lines, FE waits 16) for pattern compression
  - FF     = explicit gate-off
- waveforms 00..0F don't make any sound so could be used for other purposes
- waveforms 90..FF should not be used because noise can't be combined with others
  - 00     = stop (that would free the current FF stop)
  - 10..8F = waveform
  - 9x     = set pulse width to x00
  - Ax
  - Bx
  - Cx
  - Dx
  - Ex
  - Fx     = step backwards (FF goes back 1, F0 goes back 16 steps) for wavetable loop
- toneportamento (don't retrigger wavetable, only change frequency)
- pattern compression
- frequency pitch bending / vibrato / slide
- pulse width modulation
- filter settings & modulation
DONE:
- ZP $50-$70 usable (as long as you don't use BASIC FP at the same time)
